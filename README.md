### Welcome to my github page!


Hello, thanks for dropping by! My name is Parker and I'm a software engineer with an interest in Database systems and Geospatial systems. 
I recently (Nov '23) finished a master's focused on database systems at the Technical University of Munich. 

You can find some of my past projects on my [personal website](https://www.parkertimmins.com/), or dig through the code here on github.
Lately, I've been working on a little [star map](https://www.parkertimmins.com/celestial-sphere) application. I haven't added it to my site yet, as I'd like to accompany it with an explanatory blog post. But if you're interested, check it out! (It only works on mobile).

If you'd like to get in touch, send me a message at the committer email in some of my most recent commits.
